# Crypto Challenge Set 2

> This is the first of several sets on block cipher cryptography. This is bread-and-butter crypto, the kind
> you'll see implemented in most web software that does crypto.

> This set is relatively easy. People that clear set 1 tend to clear set 2 somewhat quickly.

> Three of the challenges in this set are extremely valuable in breaking real-world crypto; one allows you
> to decrypt messages encrypted in the default mode of AES, and the other two allow you to rewrite messages
> encrypted in the most popular modes of AES.

 * 1. Implement PKCS#7 padding
 * 2. Implement CBC mode
 * 3. An ECB/CBC detection oracle
 * 4. Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Simple)
 * 5. ECB cut-and-paste
 * 6. Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Harder)
 * 7. PKCS#7 padding validation
 * 8. CBC bitflipping attacks
